<p>For the past 2 years my musical intrest has picked up.
    I started listening to new artists and eventualy i started to
    play new istruments. I started with guitar, and then moved on to
    bass. I worked on that until i thought it sounded good and begun 
    working on drums. This year i started pkaying cello for the school
    sypmhony as my secondary instrument.
